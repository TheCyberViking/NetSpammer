# NetSpammer
Network Traffic Generation tool for annoying Blue Teams and Sys Admins and attempting to hide hidden attacks, This could be usefull for red teamers to make nosie from a random machine to cuase the defenders to pay attention to that machine more then others, possibly allow your quiter attacks to go un-noticed. This could also be used by blue teams as a training utility for the staff, while looking for possible threats on the network

## The Menu
* Simulate an Attack = This will simulate an attack on the network out your main ethernet port
* Repaly an Attack = this will replay pre-recorded network traffic out your main ethernet port
* Make noise on the Network = This will generate random traffic on the network out your main ethernet port

## Moding
Alot of the features are easily modifed changing out the pcap files while replacing them with the same nameed files, all current network pcap files are from public avilable smaple sites for each different attacks


## Future Plans
The is plans in the future to modify the current code to allow for check of a folder for pcaps to replay on the network, allowing for more modularity from the user.
